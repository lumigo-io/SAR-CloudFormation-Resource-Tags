SAR app to propagate CloudFormation's stack tags to resources that are currently not propagated automatically - e.g. CloudWatch Logs. It also propagates stack tag updates to resources whose tags are not automatically updated - e.g. Step Functions, SQS.

## Deploying to your account (via the console)

Go to this [page](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:374852340823:applications~propagate-cfn-tags) and click the `Deploy` button.

This app would deploy the following resources to your region:

* a `Propagate` Lambda function that propagates CloudFormation's tags to resources that aren't tagged automatically
* a CloudWatch event pattern that triggers the `Propagate` function whenever `CloudFormation:CreateStack` and `CloudFormation:UpdateStack` events are captured by CloudTrail
* a `PropagateAll` Lambda function that iterates through all CloudFormation stacks in the region and propates their tags, this function is only triggered once, when you deploy the SAR app
* a `Custom::LambdaInvocation` CloudFormation custom resource, which would trigger the `PropagateAll` Lambda function during the deployment of this SAR app

## Deploying via SAM/Serverless framework/CloudFormation

To deploy this app via SAM, you need something like this in the CloudFormation template:

```yml
PropagateCloudFormationTags:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Application
  Properties:
    Location:
      ApplicationId: arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:374852340823:applications/propagate-cfn-tags
      SemanticVersion: <enter latest version>
```

To do the same via CloudFormation or the Serverless framework, you need to first add the following `Transform`:

```yml
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
```
